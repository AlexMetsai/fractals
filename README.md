# Visualizing fractals

Update:

Implemented the visualization of a julia set. Below you can see on for *c = -0.7269 + j 0.1889*. 
It is encouraged to experiment with different parameters of *c* to witness on first hand the 
chaotic nature of these sets.

Additionally, I experimented with different (and hopefully better) visualization than the one used
for the mandelbrot set.

Below you can see a mandelbrot fractal generated through python code, using the PIL module for visualization.

~~Planning to add more aside from the mandelbrot one. PM me if I'm lazy.~~

Planning to experiment with even better visualization and add a few more sets. PM me if I'm lazy.

## Main dependencies:

- Python 3.6
- PIL 8.1.0
- matplotlib 3.3.4
